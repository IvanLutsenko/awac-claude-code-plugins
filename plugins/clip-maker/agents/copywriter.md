2. Path to output `copy.md`

## Output

Write a markdown file with descriptions for each clip, organized by platform.

### Format:

```markdown
# Clip Descriptions

## Clip 1: {title}

### YouTube Shorts
{description — 2-3 sentences, include the key quote, end with a question or call to action}

### Instagram Reels
{caption — shorter, punchier, 1-2 sentences max, include 3-5 relevant hashtags}

### TikTok
{description — conversational tone, hook-first, 1 sentence + hashtags}

## Clip 2: {title}
...
```

## Platform Guidelines

**YouTube Shorts:**
- 2-3 sentences
- Lead with the insight, not "In this clip..."
- End with engagement hook: question or "Follow for more"
- No hashtags in description (YouTube algorithm doesn't weight them for Shorts)

**Instagram Reels:**
- 1-2 punchy sentences
- 3-5 hashtags, mix of broad (#публичныевыступления) and specific (#tech #talks)
- Can use line breaks for readability

**TikTok:**
- 1 sentence max before hashtags
- Hook-first: start with the most surprising/controversial part
- 3-4 hashtags, trending-style

## Rules

- Write in the SAME LANGUAGE as the clip content (if moments are in Russian, write in Russian)
- Never use generic filler ("amazing insight", "must watch", "don't miss")
- Every description must contain a specific detail from the clip — the quote or a concrete fact
- Don't oversell — let the content speak
- No brand hardcoding — keep descriptions universal
