# /draw-prompt — prompt only, no browser

Same flow as `/draw` but skip the `db_open_url` step. Useful when:
- the target tab is already open and focused
- the user wants to inspect the prompt before deciding which tool to use
- generating multiple variants for A/B comparison

## Steps

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` exactly like `/draw`.
2. Resolve target + translate flag (`db_default_target`, `db_translate_enabled`).
3. Invoke `prompt-crafting` skill.
4. `pbcopy` the prompt + `db_history_append`.
5. Report:
   ```
   target: <target>
   prompt copied to clipboard.
   ```
   followed by the prompt in a fenced block.
